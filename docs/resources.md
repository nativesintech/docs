## Intro

The NiT GitHub organization runs applications on third party services, some of which are free of charge and some of which are paid. Through donations from NiT, Inc., board members, and generous companies who provide services for open source projects, NiT can host various applications on different services. These applications have mainly been based off of ideas from NiT admins who desire to see their applications built out in the open. One example of this is the NiT website which is hosted on Netlify, a free service for open source projects. However, we would like to make these services available for anyone who is interested in building a platform that supports Native communities in the open source community using open source software. This repository is intended to layout what the process is for someone who wants to use NiT resources to host their platform that empowers Native peoples.

## Request for Comment

If you are interested in utilizing NiT resources to host your platform we would like for you to open a pull request that adds a markdown file to this repository that outlines:

- What does the software do and how does it support Native communities?
- What services do you need (i.e. hosting, server, database)?
- If you would like to use a paid service like Digital Ocean, what do you estimate the monthly cost would be?

Once you have opened a pull request detailing what's above, the org admins will review your request and comment on whether it will be feasible or not to host your platform using our services. If your request is accepted, it will be merged into this repository and we will work together to get your platform up and running. If your request is denied, we will close the pull request.
