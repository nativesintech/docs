An exhaustive list of various tools and platforms we have at our disposal to build a Native tech community.

## Collaborative Organizational Software (Google For Nonprofits)

- **What is it?** Nonprofits can utilize, for free, Google's suite of products, i.e. Docs, Drive, Sheets, etc., along with a workspace for admins to manage emails, members, and groups, among other things. This makes it easy to provide emails to members, update memberships lists, and organize documents in a centralized location. When possible, we prefer to use our Google Drive for all documents pertinent to the organization so they are easily shared.
- **Who has access?** The board of directors all have access to this and any community members that would benefit from using it to improve collaboration within the community.
- **How does one get access?** An email will be sent to the board of director to gain access to our team account.

## Analytics (Umami)

- **What is it?** [Umami](https://umami.is/) is a self-hosted analytics platform that respects peoples' privacy. We host in on our Digital Ocean instance. We track analytics on sites so that we can communicate to potential funders the impact and reach we have on our sites and applications. You can access at [https://analytics.nativesintech.org](https://analytics.nativesintech.org).
- **Who has access?** The board of directors all have access.
- **How does one get access?** There is a single username and password that the board member can access through our 1Password.

## Web Conferencing (Zoom)

- **What is it?** We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for our web conferencing tool as opposed to google meets. Zoom works better for those with poor internet connection so we prefer to use most of the time.
- **Who has access?** The board of directors all have access.
- **How does one get access?** An email is sent to the board of director to join Zoom.

## Project Management (Freedcamp)

- **What is it?** [Freecamp](https://freedcamp.com/) is a free for nonprofits project management tool. It's not a great tool so we don't utilize it that much but it is available to use.
- **Who has access?** The board of directors all have access.
- **How does one get access?** An email is sent to the board of director to join Freedcamp.

## Password Management (1Password)

- **What is it?** [1Password](https://1password.com) is a password management tool that has tools for teams as well. You can save personal and team shared passwords that pertain to Natives in Tech.
- **Who has access?** The board of directors all have access.
- **How does one get access?** An email will be sent to the board of director to gain access to our 1Password vaults.

## Search Insights (Google Search Console)

- **What is it?** [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) tracks the search terms and search results for users visiting our Natives in Tech website. We have not added search term / result tracking for other sites at this point but we might in the near future.
- **Who has access?** The board of directors all have access.
- **How does one get access?** You can access the search console through our nativesintech@gmail account / email which is accessible through 1Password.
