An exhaustive list of our social projects and platforms.

## Account Management (Buffer)

- **What is it?** We use [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) to send social media campaigns to multiple accounts all at once. Our main social media accounts are: Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook. We would like to expand our social media reach to more decentralized solutions like [Mastadon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Manyverse](https://www.manyver.se/) in the future where they might become our primary method of communication.
- **Who has access?** The social media manager and the board of directors have access to this to share important information across social media as well as the individual social media accounts.
- **How does one get access?** The social media manager and board of directors will be sent an email invite to join 1Password where they will then have username and passwords for Buffer, Twitter, and Instagram. Individual access to LinkedIn and Facebook is provided by anyone who has admin access to them on those respective platforms.

## Blog (Ghost CMS)

- **What is it?** Our blog is hosted on Digital Ocean and built on the great [Ghost CMS](https://ghost.org/). It is where we write more long-form content about events, interviews about Native people in tech, and general announcements we want to elaborate on. We welcome writers and collaborators who would like to publish their content on our platform.
- **Who has access?** The blog itself is available to everyone. The CMS is available to the social media manager and the board of directors. We can also provide access to interested persons who want to write for or publish content to our platform.
- **How does one get access?** The social media manager or a board of director should get an email that invites them to the blog CMS. For interested persons who would like to write for or publish to our platform then reach out to [hello@nativesintech.org](mailto:hello@nativesintech.org) to request access.

## Forum (Discourse)

- **What is it?** Our Forum is hosted on Digital Ocean and built on the wonderful [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/). It is where Native and non-Native peoples can pose questions to the larger community, promote the work they've done for Native peoples, or start a long form discussion on a topic relevant to Native people. We use it for comments on our blog articles and to make announcements in a way to garner community feedback. However, we would like to see more non-Native people engage with our community through this medium as well as see longer form discussion between Native peoples about technology.
- **Who has access?** Anyone can access the forum once they create an account. The board of directors all have admin access.
- **How does one get access?** For non-admins you can create an account on the site. For admins, an email will be sent to you to allow you to sign-up with admin privileges.
