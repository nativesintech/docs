## Fund Raising (Open Collective)

- **What is it?** We use [Open Collective](opencollective.com/) to receive and distribute funds in a transparent manner. Any receiving of funds is tracks and any disbursement of funds can only happen through an invoice or reimbursement on the platform. We think having our finances open and transparent builds trust in our community and those who fund us.
- **Who has access?** The board of directors all have access to this.
- **How does one get access?** Each board of director will need to create an account on the Open Collective platform and then they will be invited to join our team account.

## Fiscal Sponsoring (Open Collective)

- **What is it?** In addition to receiving funding and dispersing payments, we also operate as a fiscal host on Open Collective. This allows us to help younger organizations who either have not setup their nonprofit status or have not established themselves with a bank but who want to begin receiving funding using our existing payment processing and bank setup.

## Corporate Fund Raising (Benevity Causes)
