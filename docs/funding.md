## Fund Raising (Open Collective)

- **What is it?** We use [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) to receive and distribute funds in a transparent manner. Any receiving of funds is tracks and any disbursement of funds can only happen through an invoice or reimbursement on the platform. We think having our finances open and transparent builds trust in our community and those who fund us.
- **Who has access?** The board of directors all have access to this.
- **How does one get access?** Each board of director will need to create an account on the Open Collective platform and then they will be invited to join our team account.

## Fiscal Sponsoring (Open Collective)

- **What is it?** In addition to receiving funding and dispersing payments, we also operate as a fiscal host on Open Collective. This allows us to help younger organizations who either have not setup their nonprofit status or have not established themselves with a bank but who want to begin receiving funding using our existing payment processing and bank setup.

## Corporate Fund Raising (Benevity Causes)

- **What is it?** We signed up for [Benevity Causes](https://causes.benevity.org/) initially to receive funding from those interested in funding us at AirBnB. It is a way for employees to donate to causes they care about within a corporate structure which includes matching employee donations.
- **Who has access?** The board of directors all have access to this.
- **How does one get access?** There is a single username and password that the board member can access through our 1Password.

## Grants (MIT Solve, etc.)

Over the years we have applied to various grants. The first being MIT Solve:

- [Indigenous Communities Fellowship 2021](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/2021-indigenous-communities-fellowship/solutions/46067)
- [Anti-racist Technology in the US](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/antiracist-technology/solutions/50937)

There are more grants out there but we just haven't had the funds and time to submit to them. We hope to submit for more grants in the near future.

## Taxes

If your organizations makes less than $50K dollars in total donations in any one year you can submit a Form [990-N form](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-e-file-e-postcard). We have done this for the past few years. However, once our donations grow to more than $50K a year this will need to change. For now though, we send the 990-N form each year.
