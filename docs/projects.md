## Goals

The goals of NiT is to build software that supports Native communities. That can mean a lot of different things and doesn't necessarily mean code. Although code might be the first thing you think about, there are many of areas of research that is needed in order for Natives communities to make modern software their own.

## Languages

We don't care what language you choose to build your project. You will find languages like JavaScript, Rust, ReasonML, and Elixir used in some projects but you are not required to use any of those languages. Use the language and framework you are most comfortable with.

## Creating a Project

When creating a project we recommend using a template README in order to communicate to others the goals of your project. You can find that template [here](./template.md).
