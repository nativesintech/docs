The operations section of these docs pertains to the work that NiT does on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. The goal of these docs is to help volunteers, board members, and/or interested persons who want to support NiT to be able to read through these docs and be able to contribute to the operations of NiT in a capacity they feel comfortable with.

The operations section also outlines the many tools, apps, and programs that NiT uses in order to expand its reach, build software for Native communities, and promote the work of Native people in tech.
