We met initially online via Slack and this naturally grew to become a GitHub org since most of us have used or are using GitHub. It is a central location where we can collaborate and build open-source software. It is where the NiT website git repository is hosted as well as a few others. Over time, it felt important to start a non-profit foundation to apply for grants and accept donations. It helps to have such an entity to build the organization over time especially since we do want to grow and become a self-sustaining org that supports the work we all are doing in the Native communities we are a part of. The two are not intrinsically linked but because of how the community has grown over time, those that have been active on Slack and GitHub also have positions on the NiT, Inc. board. This might change in the future and we hope that it does since the two organizations can and should operate independently. Someone who is on the NiT, Inc. board does not have to also be a NiT GitHub org admin, and vice versa. These two organizations can be distinct, with separate leadership, and still function towards common goals.
