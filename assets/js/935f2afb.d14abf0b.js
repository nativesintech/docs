Inspired by an article written about Natives in the tech field, Native technologists created a Slack group where Natives, and non-Natives alike, could gather and chat about software development. Around the same time, the Natives in Tech GitHub organization was created to host projects related to Native topics and ideas. A couple years later, Natives in Tech, Inc. was formed as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with the goal of furthering the work of the GitHub organization to the broader non-technical world.","sidebar":"docs"},"community":{"id":"community","title":"Community","description":"You can find us on various social media platforms:","sidebar":"docs"},"funding":{"id":"funding","title":"Funding","description":"Fund Raising (Open Collective)","sidebar":"docs"},"governance":{"id":"governance","title":"Governance","description":"As more people become part of the NiT GitHub organization it becomes increasingly important to articulate the governance structure for this organization to make transparent how certain roles and responsibilities are awarded and given to those in the community. For those interested in being a more integral part of the community, hopefully, this outlines the path one might take to gain more responsibilities. For those just observing, I hope this explains how you fit into the larger structure.","sidebar":"docs"},"infrastructure":{"id":"infrastructure","title":"Infrastructure","description":"Repository Hosting (GitHub)","sidebar":"docs"},"mdx":{"id":"mdx","title":"Powered by MDX","description":"You can write JSX and use React components within your Markdown thanks to MDX."},"operations_about":{"id":"operations_about","title":"About","description":"The operations section of these docs pertains to the work and technology that NiT uses on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis.

Through donations from NiT, Inc., board members, and generous companies who provide services for open source projects, NiT can host various applications on different services. These applications have mainly been based off of ideas from NiT admins who desire to see their applications built out in the open. One example of this is the NiT website which is hosted on Netlify, a free service for open source projects. However, we would like to make these services available for anyone who is interested in building a platform that supports Native communities in the open source community using open source software. This repository is intended to layout what the process is for someone who wants to use NiT resources to host their platform that empowers Native peoples.","sidebar":"docs"},"social":{"id":"social","title":"Social","description":"An exhaustive list of our social projects and platforms.","sidebar":"docs"},"template":{"id":"template","title":"Template","description":"Below is a template README for NiT projects.
